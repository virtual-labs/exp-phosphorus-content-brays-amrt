      "explanations": {
        "a": "Phosphorus binds with calcium at higher pH.",
        "b": "Sulfur compounds are unrelated to phosphorus availability.",
        "c": "Potassium compounds are separate nutrients.",
        "d": "Too general; specific compounds are formed."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Good range, but not optimal.",
